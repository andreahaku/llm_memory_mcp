- **Impact**: Migration between storage systems not reliable
- **Recommendation**: Fix before production deployment

### 3. Performance Considerations
- **Write Latency**: Higher than file storage due to video encoding
  - Video: ~380ms per item
  - File: ~0.3ms per item
- **Trade-off**: Acceptable for compression benefits in most use cases
- **Recommendation**: Document expected latency characteristics

## 🔧 FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Code Field Corruption Issue
- **Problem**: `undefined` vs empty string normalization mismatch
- **Solution**: Fixed validation logic to handle normalization correctly
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Impact**: All content fields now preserve correctly

### 2. Missing Validation Methods
- **Problem**: `validateAndRepairIndex()` method missing
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive validation with auto-repair
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Impact**: System can now self-diagnose and repair index issues

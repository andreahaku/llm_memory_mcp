- Different content sizes and complexity levels
- Mixed metadata and facet configurations
- Timestamp variations for date-based testing

### Complex Test Scenarios
- Nested data structures
- Unicode and special character content

## Performance Expectations

### Acceptable Performance Thresholds

**Write Operations:**
- Video: < 2 seconds per item (with encoding)
- File: < 500ms per item
- Batch operations: Linear scaling expected

**Read Operations:**
- Video: < 100ms per item (cached)
- File: < 50ms per item
- Sequential reads: Efficient streaming

**Storage Efficiency:**
- Video compression ratio: > 2x
- Video storage should be < 50% of file storage size
- Index overhead: < 10% of total size

### Performance Monitoring

The framework tracks:
- Operation latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Throughput metrics (ops/second)
- Memory usage patterns
- Storage efficiency ratios
- Cache hit rates

## Error Handling Validation

### Tested Error Scenarios
- Non-existent item operations
- Corrupted data handling
- Timeout and recovery scenarios
- Concurrent access conflicts
- Resource exhaustion conditions

### Expected Behaviors
- Consistent error responses between adapters

## Integration with CI/CD

### Automated Testing
The validation framework can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run Feature Parity Validation
  run: npm run validate:parity
  timeout-minutes: 60

- name: Upload Test Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: validation-reports
    path: test-reports/
```

### Deployment Gates
Use validation results as deployment gates:
- Require 100% critical test passage
- Monitor performance regression thresholds
- Validate data integrity before production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Video Processing Timeouts**
   - Increase timeout values in test configuration
   - Check FFmpeg installation and dependencies
   - Monitor system resource usage

2. **Memory Usage Warnings**
   - Large test datasets may require increased heap size
   - Use `--max-old-space-size` Node.js flag if needed
   - Monitor test isolation and cleanup

3. **Intermittent Test Failures**
   - Video encoding is non-deterministic, retry failed tests
   - Check for race conditions in concurrent tests
   - Validate test environment stability

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting environment variables:

```bash
DEBUG=llm-memory:* npm run validate:parity
NODE_ENV=test npm run validate:parity
```

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests

1. **Create test file** in `tests/` directory
2. **Follow naming convention:** `*-validation.test.ts` or `*-benchmarks.test.ts`
3. **Add to test runner** in `scripts/run-validation-tests.ts`
4. **Update package.json** with new script command
5. **Document test purpose** and expected outcomes

### Test Writing Guidelines

- Use descriptive test names and categories
